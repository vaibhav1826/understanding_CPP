/*
Problem Statement



ï»¿Preethi is learning programming and she got interested in how inline functions work. So she has been practicing questions on that.



Help her solve the code for the following question statement: Create an inline function isLeapYear() to check if a given year is a leap year.



Note: This is a sample question asked in a Capgemini interview.

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
void isLeapYear(int year)
{
    if (year % 400 == 0)
    {
        cout << year << " is a leap year";
    }
    else if (year % 100 == 0)
    {
        cout << year << " is not a leap year";
    }
    else if (year % 4 == 0)
    {
        cout << year << " is a leap year";
    }
    else
    {
        cout << year << " is not a leap year";
    }
};
int main()
{
    int a;
    cin >> a;
    isLeapYear(a);
};
