/*
You are developing a simple date management system for a small library. Each entry in the libraryâ€™s catalog must record the date when a book was added. Your task is to create a program that allows you to input a date (day, month, and year) whose attributes are declared within the class Date, display this date, and determine if the year is a leap year or not.
